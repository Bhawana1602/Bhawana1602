## 👋 Hey there, welcome to my GitHub!

I’m Bhawana — a Computer Science student at United College of Engineering and Research and an aspiring Data Analyst on a focused journey to grow every single day.

I’m passionate about learning new tech skills, building real-world projects, and turning raw data into insights that actually make sense.

Here’s what you’ll find here:

🌱 Projects I’m building while learning  
📊 Interactive Power BI dashboards  
🧹 Data cleaning & SQL practice  
🐍 Python-based analysis  
📈 My progress as I level up in data analytics  

Right now, I’m sharpening my skills in **Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python** through hands-on practice and online learning.

💡My goal?  
To transform messy datasets into clear, meaningful stories that support smarter business decisions.

If you're here to explore, collaborate, or just follow my journey — I'm really glad you're here 🤍
